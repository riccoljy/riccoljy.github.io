            <p>Hi, I'm Ricco, currently a Computer Science Undergraduate at the National University of Singapore. </p>
            <p>My current interests lie in Compiler Design, Embedded Systems, and maybe a little Database Systems. </p>
            <p>I have a passion for creating systems from scratch and love to work on improving existing systems. </p>

                <h3>The <i>A-maze-ing</i> Race | Maze-solving Robot</h3>
                <p>The "<i>The A-maze-ing</i> Race" project involved a maze which required us to create a robot which
                    can solve
                    through the maze in the shortest amount of time.</p>
                <p>
                    Along the maze, there are various pieces of coloured paper on the floor which our robot needs to
                    detect and react differently in order to complete the race. The colours help determine which
                    direction the robot has to move in through the maze at a particular way point.</p>

                <h3>Obstacle Course Robot</h3>
                <p>The objective of this project is to create a robot that is powered by a battery and is capable of
                    navigating through an obstacle course. The robot must then stop 5 cm away from a wall and deliver a
                    ping pong ball over it. The robot must fit within a cube of 30cm x 30cm x 30cm, and can only be
                    constructed using the provided materials. </p>
                <p>The time limit for completing the course is 60 seconds.</p>
